### 🚀 An Achievement I’m Proud Of
I joined a team where the QA process didn’t include a structured creation of test scenarios. In just **3 sprints**, I transformed that reality:  
- **Over 220 test cases created** ✅  
- **All cases linked to User Stories** ✅  
- **Cases integrated with reported bugs** ✅  
- **Generation of team metrics** ✅  
- **Structured quality process** ✅  

The result? The team began to see **quality as something strategic**, not just operational. This showed me the power of transforming processes!
