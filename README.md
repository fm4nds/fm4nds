I'm a passionate **software quality professional** with over **3 years of experience** working with financial and public systems, transforming processes and elevating system quality!

### 💭 My journey

I've always been fascinated by how things work and how we can make them even better. In the quality field, I found my place: where I can combine **technical analysis** with **strategic vision** to positively impact products and teams.

### 🚀 An achievement i'm proud of

I joined a team where QAs didn't have the habit of creating structured test scenarios. In just **3 sprints**, I managed to transform this reality:

- **Created over 220 test cases** ✅ 
- **Linked all cases with User Stories** ✅ 
- **Integrated cases with reported bugs** ✅ 
- **Ensured metrics generation for the team** ✅ 
- **Structured quality process** ✅ 

The result? The team started seeing quality as something **strategic**, not just operational. This showed me the power of transforming processes!
